# POP3 Email check

A simple project that is inteded to retrieve the unfetched email count from a set of POP3 accounts. It is very simple and the intention is just that, there is no email preview or any other fancy stuff.

This project was made just to exercise a bit Gambas components and INI settings save/retrieval. It relies on mpg123 to play mp3 sounds and by default it uses notify-send to popup new messages.

This is Unlicensed, use it in any way desired.
